# DMWSS

DMWSS (Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound) is a Game Boy emulator written in C++. It aims to replicate the original Game Boy’s behavior—CPU timing, memory layout, graphics, and audio output while remaining modular and easy to build on different platforms.


## Building DMWSS

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root 

2. Configure with CMake and build:

   ```bash
   cmake .
   make
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable `DMWSS`
